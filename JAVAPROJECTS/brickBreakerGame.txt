2. Brick Breaker Game
One of the pleasant ways to study technology is through implementing game applications. It may not be easy but developing this Java project will make you learn a lot of new things. This game development project will provide you with java experience and essential animation techniques with their integration.

Abstract: Many of you already heard of the brick breaker game. It has a small ball that knocks the bricks taking the help of a small platform at the base. The player handles this platform and tries to bounce the ball through that platform. In this project, the scoring depends on the number of bricked-broken, i.e., the more you destroy the bricks, the more you score.

If you missed the chance for the ball to bounce, then the game is over. This project is basically for beginners who are looking for a minor project. This simple project will surely help you with your first-year project or also as an implementation for fun purposes.


 Technologies Required:  Java, Game development, JFrame, JPanel, and Java Graphics Kit.
